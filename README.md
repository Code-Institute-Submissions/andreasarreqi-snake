# SNake





## Features 
An interactive snake game with few speed challenges when you reach a certain score


### Existing Features

  - Food (Apple) goes to a random location.
  - Snake gets longer when it collides with the apple.
  - Score gets incremented correclty each time the snake eats an apple.
  - The walls serve as borders which means you lose the game as you run into them.




### Features Left to Implement
  - Correcting the food loop so it doesn't bug.
  - Reaching the game over when the snake runs into itself.

## Testing 

Did manual testing mostly. Sometimes the food(apple) doesn't appear after reaching a certain score.
